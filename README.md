# Logodot

## Project Description

A free web app to serve simple logos upon a few color and font preferences.

## Purpose

To teach myself containerization (Docker) and Kubernetes deployments. I chose Logodot for this because I believe that containerizing the logo-serving API and frontend web app will improve the performance of the app under high load. This is primarily because image-processing is resource-intensive and could potentially interfere with the speed of serving web pages.

## Stack

- React & Antd
